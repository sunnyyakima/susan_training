there should have two files to connect local git with github in .ssh folder:
id_rsa
id_rsa.pub

if not exist,runing following
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
then just enter twice using default setting for names

this command should generate these two files in .ssh.

copy the conetent of id_rsa.pub, then paste it to the SSH key field in github (settings --> SSH keys
